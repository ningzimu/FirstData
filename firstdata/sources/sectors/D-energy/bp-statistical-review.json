    "en": "The Energy Institute Statistical Review of World Energy™ analyses data on world energy markets from the prior year. Previously produced by bp (British Petroleum) since 1952, the Review has been continued by the Energy Institute since 2024, providing timely, comprehensive and objective data to the energy community. The Review covers global energy statistics including production, consumption, trade, and prices across all major energy sources: coal, oil, natural gas, nuclear, hydroelectric, and renewable energy. In collaboration with KPMG, Kearney, Heriot-Watt University, and with support from S&P Global Commodity Insights and bp.",
