## 🎯 Why FirstData?

### The Fact Defense Line in the AI Era: From "Information Overload" to "Truth Scarcity"

In today's era where Generative AI is reshaping the internet, **"information" has become unprecedentedly abundant, while "truth" is becoming scarce**.

When noise, patchwork content, and hallucinations become the default background, **trusted primary sources are no longer just reference materials, but the foundation of the entire intelligence system**.

### Our Mission: Building the Trusted Foundation for the AI Era

This project aims to build a **global, authoritative, and structured Primary Sources knowledge base**.

We systematically discover and aggregate high-trust sources across domains—covering scientific research, government disclosures, laws and regulations, corporate filings and financial reports, standards and authoritative industry materials—**transforming scattered, non-standard, difficult-to-reuse original content into traceable, verifiable, and citable "Core Facts"**, while preserving complete evidence chains and version history, ensuring that every conclusion can be traced "back to the source".

### This is a "Fact Defense Line" for the Large Model Era

✅ **Provide anti-hallucination, anti-poisoning trusted foundation for models**

- Plans to cover 1000+ authoritative data sources (all from government agencies, international organizations, academic institutions, and authoritative industry associations worldwide)
- 100% URL validation to ensure link availability

✅ **Provide computable, reviewable evidence chain closure for Deep Research**

- Structured metadata system with complete access paths
- Support programmatic access for automated evidence tracing

✅ **Upgrade AI from "vaguely summarizing secondary information" to "rigorous reasoning and citation based on primary evidence"**

- MCP intelligent Agent understands complex queries and accurately recommends authoritative data sources
- Provides complete paths to original data (URL, API, download methods)
- Includes use cases and citation examples to ensure proper usage

> **In the GenAI era, Clean Data > Big Model.**
>
> **Let every deep thought be built on verifiable facts.**

## 🎯 FirstData MCP

**Connecting Natural Language with Primary Authoritative Data - The "Last Mile"**

---

We've built a structured knowledge base of authoritative data sources, each with complete metadata, access paths, and authority identifiers. But for most users, the real challenge is: How to quickly find the most suitable one among massive data sources? Once you find the data source website, how to accurately locate the target data on complex official platforms? How to seamlessly integrate all this into your daily AI workflow?

**FirstData MCP** is built for this purpose—transforming a static data source knowledge base into a dynamic intelligent navigation system, making authoritative data accessible to everyone.

---

### 📖 Why FirstData MCP?

In the LLM era, we're used to asking for answers directly, but often face two core pain points:

❌ **Pain Point 1: Untraceable Data Sources (Hallucination Risk)**

- AI-generated numbers may be outdated, incorrect, or completely fabricated
- Lack of original evidence chain, unable to trace and verify
- Secondary citations lose original context through layers of retelling

❌ **Pain Point 2: High Barrier to Professional Databases (Difficult Retrieval)**

- Government and international organization websites have complex navigation and obscure terminology
- Don't know which data source is most authoritative and what its coverage is
- Even after finding the official website, don't know how to locate target data

### 💡 Our Solution

**This MCP service builds a complete closure from "vague intent" to "precise data path":**

It doesn't directly generate potentially outdated numbers, but acts as an **"authoritative data guide"**, directing users to trusted primary sources such as national statistical bureaus, World Bank, industry white papers, etc., and provides **retrieval manuals with specific click-by-click steps**.

> **Let data return to authority, let retrieval no longer get lost.**

---

### ✨ Core Features
